I am Sascha Marton, a  Machine Learning Researcher at the University of Mannheim in Germany, where I have been pursuing my PhD since 2019. My research is centered on advancing machine learning techniques for tabular data, with a recent focus on gradient-based decision tree learning and tree-based ensemble methods.

Research Interests
======
My current work involves developing a new approach for learning hard, axis-aligned decision trees using gradient descent. This method employs backpropagation with a straight-through operator on a dense decision tree representation, allowing for the joint optimization of all tree parameters. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art performance across various domains, including interpretable decision trees and high-performance decision tree ensembles for tabular data, as well as interpretable reinforcement learning without information loss.

My primary research interests include:
* Ensemble Methods
* Deep Learning for Tabular Data
* Explainable Artificial Intelligence
